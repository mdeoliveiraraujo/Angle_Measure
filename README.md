# Angle_Measure
Firmwire to STM32 based control board with ADS1256, SD Card data logging, MPU6050 inertial unit and XBee wireless communication.

A puzzle-style code brought together throughout seek-and-destroy issues method *hehe*

Based on code found on git and other places.

Kudos to the following names for paving the way:

https://github.com/leech001 (MPU6050 (I2C) with Kalman Filter)
https://controllerstech.com/ (SD Card (SPI))
https://github.com/mbilsky, https://github.com/Flydroid and https://github.com/dariosalvi78 (ADS1256 (SPI))

I came up with a somewhat nice implementation to build a 512 byte block for data logging. May be suitable for larger blocks as well.

Enjoy!
